    "## Week 2 - Scraping Data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Name: Ruixin Huang \n",
    "\n",
    "#### NIM: 2802466713\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Task Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Try to scrape data from any html dataset. Pick your favourite website that maybe useful for your project topic later on.\n",
    "2. Store the data into csv format, try at least get 5 columns for each data.\n",
    "3. For extra miles, you can also scrape as many as possible from more than one source.\n",
    "\n",
    "The website I choose is **Yahoo Finance**, \n",
    "I originally use direct scraping, but the data might be not accessible -> SO I use Yahoo Finance API \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plans**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The web structure understanding**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Yahoo Finance contains useful data like stock prices, financial statements, and historical data for various companies.\n",
    "- The information typically lies within tables, spans, or other HTML tags, which we need to target in the scraping process.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Selecting the Data**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Technical Indicator Data**: Extract technical indicators like moving averages, Relative Strength Index (RSI)\n",
    "\n",
    "-  **Historical Data**: Gather historical data (daily close, open, high, low, and volume) for a time-series dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  **Multiple Stock Data**: Extend the scraping to multiple stocks for diversified trading strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Scalable and Modular Code**: Create functions for scalability and better maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  **Error Handling and Logging**: Implement robust error handling and logging for better diagnostics.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  **Efficient Data Storage**: Store the scraped data in CSV format with appropriate labels and historical data, making it easier for later use in machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Deatils of Indicators I used**\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1. Simple Moving Average (SMA)\n",
    "    - Definition: The Simple Moving Average (SMA) is calculated by taking the average of a stock’s closing prices over a specific period. It smooths out price data by creating a constantly updated average price.\n",
    "    - Calculation: In this project, we calculate the 20-day SMA by averaging the stock’s closing prices over the last 20 trading days.\n",
    "    - Purpose:\n",
    "        - SMA helps identify trends over time. For example, if the stock price is consistently above its 20-day SMA, it could indicate an uptrend, while prices below the SMA might suggest a downtrend.\n",
    "        - Traders often use SMA to smooth out short-term fluctuations and make it easier to spot longer-term trends.\n",
    "- 2. Exponential Moving Average (EMA)\n",
    "    - Definition: The Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is similar to the SMA but gives more weight to recent prices. This makes the EMA more sensitive to recent price changes compared to the SMA.\n",
    "    - Calculation: We calculate the 20-day EMA in this project, meaning that recent prices have a stronger influence on the average than prices from earlier in the period.\n",
    "    - Purpose: EMA responds faster to recent price movements, which is particularly useful in detecting changes in trends early.\n",
    "    - MA is often preferred by traders who want to react more quickly to market changes compared to the slower-moving SMA.\n"
